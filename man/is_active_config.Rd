\usage{
is_active_config(config)
}
\arguments{
\item{config}{Configuration name}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether the specified configuration is active
}
\description{
Check whether a configuration is currently active
}
\details{
The name of the currently active configuration is read from the
\code{R_CONFIG_ACTIVE} environment variable. If the variable is
not defined then the "default" configuration is used.

To test for whether a configuration is active you should use the
\code{\link{is_active}} function rather than inspecting the
environment variable directly (this is to so that tests remain
valid if other means of specifing configurations are introduced
in the future).
